# A Step by Step Guide to Using Proxyium
Proxyium is a web proxy that provides free anonymous web unblocking services. You don’t need to install any software to use it. By visiting its website and entering the desired URL, Proxyium redirects your traffic through its proxy server and retrieves responses from the target website server. 

### What Does a Proxy Do?

A proxy server acts as a bridge between you and the internet. Normally, when you browse the internet using a browser, you connect directly to the website you are visiting. However, when you use a proxy, your browser first connects to the proxy server, which then forwards your traffic to the desired website. The proxy server receives the website’s response and returns it to you, effectively masking your IP address. This allows you to bypass internet restrictions without revealing personal information. Additionally, a proxy establishes a secure connection, safeguarding user data and ensuring a safe online environment. Whether you want to access geo-restricted content, protect your online privacy, or enhance your internet security, a proxy is a useful tool.
